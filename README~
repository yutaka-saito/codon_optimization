== Codon optimization based on the mRNA folding energy and the codon frequency

version 0.1


==== Requirements

EnsembleEnergy program in RNAstructure package
https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/RNAstructure.html


==== Usage

For example,
$ codon_optimization_HC.pl misc/translation_table misc/codon_frequency example/gi_21219378.fa utr/pTip.fa output_directory >  



Cosearge consists of three steps.
(1) normalization
(2) search
(3) test

(1) normalize a HiC contact matrix
$ 3DColocNormalize --proc n --verbose example/matrix/chr22

(2) search for the colocalization of genomic elements
$ 3DColocSearch --suffix_smp n example/matrix/chr22 example/element/mRNA.chr22.bed example/element/gap.chr22.txt example/out/subset example/out/score

(3) test the colocalization for detected subsets
$ for i in `seq 0 9` ; do
3DColocTest --suffix n example/matrix/chr22 example/out/subset.$i example/element/gap.chr22.txt example/out/pz.$i /dev/null
done

==== Input files

You need following input files:
(1) HiC contact matrix
(2) genomic elements
(3) chromosome gaps

(1) HiC contact matrix
The HiC contact matrix is represented by several files included in one directry.
See example/matrix/chr22 that contains the HiC contact matrix of the human chromosome 22.
"binNumber" contains the number of bins. (1243 bins)
"resolution" contains the length of each bin. (40000 bp)
Note that "binNumber * resolution" is equal to the length of the human chromosome 22. (1243 * 40000)
"positionIndex" contains the genomic position of each bin. (0, 40000, 80000, 120000, ...)
"genomeIdxToLabel" contains the index given to each chromosome.
In this example, the HiC contact matrix represents only one chromosome, the human chromosome 22, and thus the index "0" is given to the chromosome "22".
"chromosomeIndex" contains the index of the chromosome to which each bin belongs.
In this example, all bins belong to the chromosome "22" whose index is "0".
"chromosomeStarts" contains the i-th bin from which each chromosome starts.
In this example, there is only one chromosome, which starts from the 0-th bin.
"heatmap" contains the contact intensities represented as the binNumber*binNumber matrix.
After the normalization step by 3DColocNormalize, the two additional files are produced.
"heatmap_n" contains the normalized contact intensities.
"statistics_n" contains the summary statistics used in normalization.

(2) genomic elements
The genomic elements are represented by BED format.
See example/element/mRNA.chr22.bed that contains all known mRNA transcripts in the human chromosome 22.

(3) chromosome gaps
The chromosome gaps are represented by gap table format used in the UCSC genome database.
See example/element/gap.chr22.txt that contains gap positions in the human chromosome 22.


==== Output format

After the search step by 3DColocSearch, two kinds of output files are produced.

(1) colocalized subsets of genomic elements
See example/out/subset.*

(2) colocalization scores
See example/out/score.*

After the test step by 3DColocTest, additional output files are produced.

(3) p-values and z-scores of colocalization scores
See example/out/pz.*
